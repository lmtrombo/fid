<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to read about me and my experiences. I am a Digital Designer that focuses on translating creative concepts into product supporting visual design, brand creation and front-end design and development. I specialize in Web Communication, UI/UX Design, Interactive Design, Product Design, Project Management, Video Editing and Motion Graphics, Brand Identity and Branded Content. <br>I earned an Associates Degree in Digital Cinema and TV Production and also Digital Media from Seminole State College. I then continued on to recieve a Bachelor's of Arts in Graphic Design and a Master's Degree in Design Management from Savannah College of Art and Design. While earning these degrees I continued my passion projects of creating and branding a Youtube Channel and Illustrating a published children's book. With a background in theater I find it important to work well in a team and be able to share creative goals with one another in a professional, kind manner. I find it vital to be able to practice multiple skills each day and to navigate work towards those that can manage it and execute it best to create a cohesive and succesful design. I look forward to working with an abundance of teams in the future to learn and grow from each member and experience.</p>
