<h1>Alayna Joy</h1>

<p>Alayna Joy Fender (born: April 12, 1992 [age 29]), formerly known as MissFenderr, is a Canadian YouTuber settled in Vancouver, British Columbia. Her videos mainly consist of vlogs. She often did them along with her ex-fiancé, Dallas.</p>

<p>She also has a second channel called MissAlaynaa, which started off with her doing beauty videos up until December 2014, when it turned into a daily Vlog channel, following the yearly vlogger trend, "Vlogmas", where one would vlog every day from the start of December up until Christmas. She has since continued vlogs often on this channel.</p>

<p>She used to wear a cat shirt in almost every video, although she has since stopped this. She is a big cat lover and has three cats she had two before, a white cat called Quitan and a dark grey cat called Bear. A few days before Christmas 2014, Quitan became extremely ill after taking medicine for an illness he had, but after setting up an Indegogo campaign, raised over $2000 CAD and Quitan made a full recovery. Quitan passed away very suddenly towards end of October of 2017, he had to be put down after the illness he had gotten the medicine for in 2014 came back and he got extremely ill one evening. This was a blood clot in his heart of which a piece broke off and got lodged in his back which cut off circulation to back legs, started heart failure, and filled his lungs with fluid. After all this he sadly was. A few months after his passing she fostered a pregnant cat who had six kittens of which she eventually kept two, one black female named Boogie and one tiger female named Blue.</p> 

<p>In early August 2015, she revealed that she is bisexual, and went through traumatizing anxiety as a child and teenager in her "Draw my Life" video. In late 2016, Fender moved to Vancouver, British Columbia from Winnipeg, Manitoba. She stated she had decided this in a trip there earlier that year. In August of 2019, she got engaged to her now ex-fiancé, David with whom she lived.</p>

<p>On May 7, 2020, at the surprise to her fans, she posted a video saying that she was actually gay and not bisexual, and she thought she had to be bisexual because she loved her fiancé, Dallas, but she still only found herself to only love women in the romantic and sexual sense. Dallas and Alayna broke up a month before she posted the video, but are still on good terms.</p>
