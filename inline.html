<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In <dfn>sous vide cooking</dfn>, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is <em>precisely</em> set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30</time>.</p>
